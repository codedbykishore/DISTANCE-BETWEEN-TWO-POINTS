# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start the program
### Step 2: 
Import math function and assign values of points in list
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Display the result
### Step 5:
Stop the program 
### PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
l=[4,2]
li=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((li[0]-l[0])**2+(li[1]-l[1])**2)
print(round(distance,2))
```
